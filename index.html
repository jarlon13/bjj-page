        <h2>About Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)</h2>
        <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art and combat sport system that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting. BJJ was formed from Kodokan Judo ground fighting (Newaza) fundamentals that were taught by a number of individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda, and Soshihiro Satake.</p>
        <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and adaptation of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and more modern developments in martial arts. BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using proper technique and leverage, most notably by applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations.</p>
